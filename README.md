#Tidemap#

Tidemap is the portal through which customers view our interactive mapping data products, served out of GeoServer.

It's based around Leaflet with a little bit of Bootstrap thrown in for UI.

It's developed using a Yeoman template and uses Bower for package management and Gulp for build/test/deploy.
