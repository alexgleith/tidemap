# Tidemap

Tidemap is the portal through which customers view our interactive mapping data products, served out of GeoServer.

It's based around Leaflet with a little bit of Bootstrap thrown in for UI.

It's developed using a Yeoman template and uses Bower for package management and Gulp for build/test/deploy.
## Dependencies
I'm a little unclear of exactly what is required, but you definitely need to install npm, bower and gulp. Try this:

`npm install --global yo gulp-cli bower`

Then clone the repo
## How to develop
1. Check out the repository
2. Install the bower components using `bower update`
